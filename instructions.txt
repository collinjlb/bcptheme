Alright, listen up.

The map plugin is MapSVG.
To control the map, there are a few different elements in play to make this entire thing work.

1. Open up the MapSVG tab in the backend.
2. On the right view, click on the drop down menu and go to "Regions".
3. This is where we set the active states in which BCP has companies in. When active, change the color to #efefef.
4. Take note of any id "US-(STATE)" in which the state is active.
!IMPORTANT - That is literally all that should be done while in the plugin. :)

After you have this information, go to custom fields and edit "Location Content"

1. Click on Locations and go into the sub-field "Companies" in the repeater.
2. This is a checkbox field, and the value is an anchor tag. The anchor tag should be created and edited to go to the correct company
page and background image should be changed to the correct logo url.
3. The label will in fact be printed out into the front-end, so be sure to make the label the company name as it should be displayed.
4. After all 7 companies are created with the proper value and label, update and travel to the "Options" Page.

The Locations ID needs to match the ID taken from the MapSVG Plugin. The State will be displayed on the front end, so make sure it's
spelled correctly.

1. Select the companies that are in respective state.



## FOR DEVELOPERS
The mobile option select is matched with the state id to take you to the locations page. There is a simple script running to take you
to the locations page with a hash of the selected state ID. It'll auto scroll to the tabs when it reaches the page and then functions
as ordinary bootstrap tabs.
